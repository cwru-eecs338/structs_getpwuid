Using Structs and getpwuid()
============================

Getting the files:
------------------

On the lab computers, use the command:
<pre><code>
git clone git://github.com/cwru-eecs338/structs_getpwuid.git
</code></pre>

Lessons:
--------

* Creating structured types (structs)
* Initializing structs
* Accessing struct members (from varaible or pointer)
* Determining the memory size of a struct, and allocating on heap
* Using the <code>getpwuid()</code> call to get user information

Resources:
----------

The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language) )
actually has a pretty good overview of struct syntax, etc.
