Using Structs and getpwuid()
============================

Getting the files:
------------------
On the lab computers, use the command:

    git clone git://github.com/cwru-eecs338/structs_getpwuid.git

Lessons:
--------
* Creating structured types (structs)
* Initializing structs
* Accessing struct members (from varaible or pointer)
* Determining the memory size of a struct, and allocating on heap
* Using the `getpwuid()` call to get user information

Resources:
----------
The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_%28C_programming_language%29 )
actually has a pretty good overview of struct syntax, etc.
